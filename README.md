# Mini ML Projects
Short machine learning projects to practise different skills and models within machine learning. 

A brief overview on the projects and what skills were focused on:

* **KNN Animals:** using KNN to classify different animals. Focusing on learning how to build basic classification models and data preparation steps. 

* **Safe Drivers:** understanding how to use upsampling, downsampling, and SMOTE as ways to handle imbalanced datasets for classification purposes.

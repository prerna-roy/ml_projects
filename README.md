# Mini ML Projects
Short machine learning projects to practise different skills and models within machine learning. 

A brief overview on the projects and what skills were focused on:

* **KNN Animals:** using KNN to classify different animals. Focusing on learning how to build basic classification models and data preparation steps. Also used Decision Tree and Random Forests to see if there are noticeable changes in accuracy. 

* **Safe Drivers:** understanding how to use upsampling, downsampling, and SMOTE as ways to handle imbalanced datasets for classification purposes.
